# Futsal-Field-Booking-System

### Use Cases:
In a Futsal playground, a visitor can make a reservation or in other terms book a field which will later be provided by the service at the futsal venue. In this case, visitors can make several bookings, and one field can make many bookings which later in one field will be provided with one service.

### Scenario Analysis :
- Find the average length of play of visitors?
- Looking for a visitor's name with an above average playing time?
- The distance between booking and playing time for each visitor?
- Which futsal field is often used to play?
- The field that has been used the longest to play?
